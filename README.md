# HelloWorld
Baby steps to a Data Science career. This is my start-up repository.
I guess we all start somewhere, don't we? 
I am Dennis, Metis Boocamp freshman, making my debut on Github. I just qualified for the Data Science & Engineering Bootcamp with Metis - only to realize that I hadn't learn a thing about Github yet..! Such a nut-head!
